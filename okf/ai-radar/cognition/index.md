# cognition

Brain-inspired memory and thinking architectures for AI agents: dual-process
(fast/slow) thinking, hierarchical + episodic/semantic memory, consolidation
and replay ("dreaming"), and cognitive architectures (ACT-R/Soar lineage)
applied to LLMs. Findings here are weighted by concrete adoptability for one
of two downstream consumers: (a) this project's own personal Claude Code
memory layer (typed markdown memory files + a knowledge graph over them), or
(b) a community-wide shared knowledge base ("community brain") — not by
hype.

New topic as of 2026-08-27. Two existing entries under `knowledge/` predate
this topic and are cross-linked here rather than duplicated:
[anthropic-dreaming-memory](/knowledge/anthropic-dreaming-memory.md) and
[graphiti-zep](/knowledge/graphiti-zep.md) / [cognee](/knowledge/cognee.md)
(knowledge-graph memory cluster).
