# Summary

GLM-5.3 released 2026-08-14 by Zhipu/Z.ai. Reuses the GLM-5.2 base model
unchanged (743B params) — all gains come from post-training. Reports a jump
on Terminal-Bench 3.0 from 4.6% to 28.3%, a large improvement on complex,
long-horizon coding/agentic tasks. 1M token context, 128K output. Coding Plan
pricing starts at $18/mo; GLM-5.2/5.1 API requests are auto-routed to 5.3.
Open weights followed ~2026-08-28, alongside a smaller open-weight
"GLM-5.3-Flash" variant released 2026-08-26.

# Why this is in the radar

Not previously tracked in the bundle (no prior GLM entries existed). This
setup has GLM (z.ai) alternate-provider groundwork already (see the global
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` "GLM (z.ai)" section and `scripts/claude-glm.ps1`), so a
GLM lineage update is directly relevant to that integration's model choice.

# Repo / source check

Model weights, not a tool repo in the usual sense; open-weights release is
imminent/rolling out as of this scan (~2026-08-28) rather than already
public. Grounding: MarkTechPost and explainx.ai coverage via WebSearch (direct
fetch of marktechpost.com was blocked by this sandbox's egress proxy — this
entry is corroborated via search-aggregated summaries, not a primary fetch).
Marked `current` on the strength of two independent outlet write-ups, not yet
independently verified against an official Z.ai model card.

# Notes

- Confirm open-weight availability and license terms once released
  (~2026-08-28) at the next scan.

# Update (2026-09-08 scan): GLM-5.3-Flash unmasked and detailed

GLM-5.3-Flash — first noted above as imminent — surfaced publicly in late
August as a mystery "Ox Alpha" stealth model on OpenRouter/LMArena, then was
attributed to Z.ai in early September. It is a 320B-total/18B-active MoE
model with hybrid linear+sparse attention, native multimodal input (text,
image, video, file), and a context window reported inconsistently across
sources as either 1,048,576 or 1,310,720 tokens (unresolved — check Z.ai's
own docs before citing a hard number) with up to 131,072 output tokens.
Z.ai list pricing: $0.15/M input, $0.03/M cached input, $0.50/M output, no
context-length tiering. One source (codersera.com) describes it as
MIT-licensed open weight — not independently confirmed. Positioned for
efficient coding and long-horizon agent workloads. Sourced from OpenRouter,
Artificial Analysis, DataCamp, LLM Gateway, and llm-stats.com (Z.ai's own
blog was not directly fetched this pass).
